# Open source community wiki example
# Based on cantara.github.io/wiki — a 2,290-article archive of an open source
# community knowledge base covering IAM, microservices, agile, and enterprise architecture.
#
# Shows: topology across a large multi-section knowledge base, dependency chains
# between architecture → implementation → operations layers, freshness distinction
# between archive content and actively maintained files, and audience targeting
# for developer, operator, and architect roles.
